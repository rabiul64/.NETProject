# Project Title : Investigate Label Prediction from the time-series sequence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction : 
This project is an investigation of label prediction from the time series sequence and develops the code for multisequence learning and prediction in 
the [neocortexapi](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi) repository. The project's findings also demonstrated that label prediction from a time series
data set utilizing multisequence learning is the best option for dealing with time prediction.
